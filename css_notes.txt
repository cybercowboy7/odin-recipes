Selectors:
HTML elements to which CSS rules apply

- * = universal Selector
    - will select elements of any type
    Example:
        * {
            color: purple;
        }
    - Every element would have the color: purple applied to it

- Type Selectors  
    - will select all elements of the given element
    type, and the syntax is just the name of the element


- Class Selectors 
    - Will select all elements with the given Class,
    which is just an attribute you place on the HTML 
    element
    - Example:
    <!-- index.html -->

    <div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>
    /* styles.css */

    .alert-text {
        color: red;
    }


- ID Selectors
    - Select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute
    you place on an HTML element.
    - Major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have 
    one ID. I cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace
    Example:

    <!-- index.html -->
    <div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>

    /* styles.css */
    #title {
        background-color: red;
    }

- Grouping selector 
    - Can group two selectors together as a comma-separated list
    Example

    .read,
    .unread {
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
    }

- Chaining selectors 
    - Example:
    original HTML
    <div>
        <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
        <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
    </div>

    Chaining

    .subsection.header {
        color: red;
    }

    - Selects any element that has both the subsection and header
    classes. 


- Descendant combinator
    - Combinators combine multiple selectors differently than either grouping original
    chaining them
    - Four types of Combinators
    - main one being the descendant combinator, represented in CSS by a single space between
    selectors


- Properties
    - Color and background color:
        - color property sets an element's text color
        - background-color sets the background color of an element
        - they both accept keywords or HEX, RGB, or HSL values

- Typography basics and text-align
    - font-family can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what
    font an element uses
        - best practice: family: "Times New Roman", serif;
    - font-size will set the size of the font
        - should not contain whitespace: font-size: 22px
    - font-weight affects the boldness of text 
        - value can be a keyword: font-weight: bold
        - or a number from 1-1000
    - text-align aligns text horizontally within an element
        - example: text-align: center

- Image height and weight
    - <img> element's height and weight values will be the same as the acutal image
    file's height and weight.
    - To adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions,
    you would use a value of "auto" for the height property and adjust the width value
    -Example:

    img {
        height: auto;
        width: 500px;
    }

    - This would result in a height of 250px


- Adding CSS to HTML

    - External CSS
        - Most common method
        - Involves creating a separate file for the CSS
        and linking it inside of an HTML's opening and closign <head> tags with
        a self-closing <link> element
        Example:

        <!-- index.html -->

        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        </head>

        /* styles.css */

        div {
            color: white;
            background-color: black;
        }

        p {
            color: red;
        }

- Internal CSS
    - Adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating
    a separate file
    - all rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <style> tags
    which are then placed inside of <head> tags of the HTML file

- Inline CSS
    - Add styles directly to HTML elements
    - Not recommended
